**William’s Wildlife Adventure** is a point and click game set in a cozy cute wee town where all the animals can talk. William is a young boy who loves to read and one evening, after reading his favourite storybook, finds himself drifting off into a deep sleep. He wakes up and realises he is in the animal town from his book! What’s even more of a surprise for little William, is that he is now in fact a small gecko! On this adventure, you’ll meet many different animals who all have their own set of skills and personalities. Can you help young William to get back home to reality? He has school tomorrow his mother would be disappointed if he overslept! This game focuses on teaching children the importance of stories and using their imagination to learn and have fun.
